We want to help artists publish comics on the web. So we compiled our coding know-how into a handy book to help them master HTML and CSS.

As CMS developers, we’re deep into the technical aspects of publishing webcomics. Many of our artist friends are too — some more reluctantly than others. Frankly, most would rather draw comics than hack code. And we can’t blame them. [So we wrote a book aimed at webcomic artists](https://gumroad.com/l/SACCb).

## What’s inside

At a glance, we wrote and illustrated:

- Different kinds of tags and how to use them
- The relationship between HTML and CSS
- Fundamentals of theming the Grawlix CMS with show() and PHP snippets
- Best-practice techniques for clean, easy-to-edit code
- Elements vs. tags vs. attributes
- Techniques to prevent trouble down the road
- The vital sections of a HTML document
- The fundamentals of web page layout
- Common CSS selectors and properties

Our 54-page illustrated guide to coding webcomics covers more than mere tags. It’s about *understanding* the ins and outs of HTML & CSS; the principles and best-practices; how to prevent tangled tags.

It also comes with quizzes to test your understanding along the way, and each chapter builds upon the last.

## Who’s it for

While we wrote the book with complete n00bs in mind, we soon found that experts learned a thing or two as well. We also wrote it for webcomic artists — but the material has its roots in presentations Ben’s been giving since the early 2000s.

We recommend it for anyone who looks at Grawlix CMS themes and asks, “what can I edit without breaking something?”

			<h1><a href="/blog/post/patreon-cms-features">Surprisingly popular — and not so popular — features</a></h1>
			<p>We’ve been polling the webcomics community for what features of the Grawlix CMS (or any system). While we knew some tools would outpace others, we didn’t expect ads to fall in dead last. <a href="/blog/post/patreon-cms-features">Learn what makes the grade</a></p>

			<h1><a href="/blog/post/login-checks-out-and-so-does-ben">Security checks out … and so did I</a></h1>
			<p>Security is essential to any web app like ours. But for a while ours was a little too strong. For instance, there was the time I logged out of the CMS — and couldn’t get back in. <a href="/blog/post/login-checks-out-and-so-does-ben">Unlock the security story</a></p>

			<h1><a href="/blog/post/introducing-asterisk-webcomic-theme">Asterisk: a new theme for webcomics</a></h1>
			<p>Part theme, part instruction manual, Asterisk was designed (pun intended) to help webcomic artists make sense of HTML & CSS. You can control almost every aspect of the theme’s look-n-feel in CSS alone, and develop your own unique tones along the way. <a href="/blog/post/introducing-asterisk-webcomic-theme">*</a></p>

			<h1><a href="/blog/post/webcomic-transcripts-help-seo">A SEO challenge: boosting webcomics’ searchability</a></h1>
			<p>A great way to find new readers is to help them find you. That means Search Engine Optimization (SEO). But can search engines scan text locked into word balloons? No. Artists need to take an extra step. <a href="/blog/post/webcomic-transcripts-help-seo">Optimize your thinking</a></p>

			<p>Lettering is an integral part of making comics, either web or print. But can it be more than words on a page? We talked to two artists about typography in webcomics to find out. <a href="/blog/post/typography-in-webcomics">Learn to deal with your type</a></p>

			<h1><a href="/blog/post/designing-webcomic-site">Comic-first website design</a></h1>
			<p>More than making a site that looks good, artists designing a webcomic site must solve problems in communication. They have to quickly tell readers where they are, set the comic’s tone, show readers how to get around the site — and make sure it works well in a variety of browsers and screen sizes. <a href="/blog/post/designing-webcomic-site">Put first things first</a></p>

			<p>Smartphones and tablets are among the most popular web-surfing tools today. That’s a problem for webcomic sites, which are often designed with large screens in mind.

			<h1><a href="/blog/post/tips-to-optimize-graphics">Tips to optimize graphics</a></h1>
			<p>Today many high-resolution screens have pixels so small that people can’t see them individually. As pixels get smaller, so do the images they comprise. A 600-pixel-wide image that reads well on desktop screens will also fit comfortably in a handheld iPhone — and make readers squint. That’s a problem. <a href="/blog/post/tips-to-optimize-graphics">Look sharp, load fast</a></p>

Here’s the deal. We know that once software gets into the wild, people can — and will — copy it. They’ll share it, they’ll tinker with it. We can’t stop them. And why should we try? So we decided to release the Grawlix CMS with the [MIT open source license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), like this:

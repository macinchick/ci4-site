**MySQL, often pronounced “my sequel,” is a relational database we use to hold most of the information in a Grawlix-based website.** 

Your web host is responsible for creating and holding the database, although the Grawlix CMS adds its own tables to that database [upon installation](./installation). Think spreadsheets that talk to each other. Failing that, you can [ask for a fresh copy](/forum) of the database.

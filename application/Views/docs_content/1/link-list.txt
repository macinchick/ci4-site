**A “link list” is a collection of sites that artists want to share with her/his readers.** The Grawlix CMS comes with two link lists: One that appears on the side of a page, and one that *is* an entire page.

## Sidebar link list

You can edit the first kind — let’s call it the **side link list** in the admin panel. Look on the left for “link list.” Here each link can have:

- a title (text that the readers tap)
- a URL (address of the site they’ll visit)
- and an optional image (uploaded from your computer)



There is no limit to the number of links you can have. Not beyond common sense, I mean.

## Link list static page

The **link list page** is a [static page](./static-pages) dedicated to taking people to other websites. Link the side link list, each item on the link list page has:

- a title (text that the readers tap)
- a URL (address of the site they’ll visit)
- and an optional image (uploaded from your computer)

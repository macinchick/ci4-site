**An URL is a page’s unique address on the web.** For example:

- <span class="path">www.getgrawlix.com/docs</span>
- <span class="path">www.getgrawlix.com/download</span>
- <span class="path">foundation.zurb.com/docs</span>
- <span class="path">foundation.zurb.com/develop/download.html</span>

… are four different URLs. Every, both [static](./static-pages) and [comic](./comic-pages), has one.

Now, your site has a *domain name* like, for example, **mycomic.com**. A “domain name” is the bit that ends with “.com”, “.cc”, “.co.uk”, “.info” etc. Everything after that is the page’s location within the website. Domain name is the website. Everything else is *within* the website. Like this:

- <span class="path">www.getgrawlix.com**/docs**</span>
- <span class="path">www.getgrawlix.com**/download**</span>
- <span class="path">foundation.zurb.com**/docs**</span>
- <span class="path">foundation.zurb.com**/develop/download.html**</span>

“/docs” shows up twice, and that’s OK. They belong to two different domains. It’s cool.

<aside>**Getting geeky:** Yes, I know that there are [URLs and URIs](https://blog.udemy.com/url-vs-uri/). For purposes of this discussion, they’re all URLs. Likewise, TLDs are a talk for another time.</aside>

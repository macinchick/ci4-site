We’d like to thank our friends and family for supporting us during the early days. Most notably Bill and Linda Gremillion whose donations got us off the ground; [Jeff Laclede](http://jefflaclede.com) who alpha tested the Grawlix CMS in the early days and created Bleep; and [Brad Guigar](http://evil-inc.com) whose advice, candor and experience made this project sing.

We’d also like to give shout-outs to [ZURB](http://foundation.zurb.com), [Panic](http://www.panic.com/coda/) and [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/) and [North of Three](http://www.sequelpro.com) for making our lives easier.

You too can [support the Grawlix CMS on Paetron](http://patreon.com/grawlixcomix). While we let you download the system for free, your money helps us keep the Grawlix CMS alive with feature updates and bug fixes.

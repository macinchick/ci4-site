**Comic pages are the building blocks of a comic’s narrative or, in the case of daily comics, the one-off jokes that people come to read.**

Comic pages are different from [static pages](./static-pages), which only support the website. Static pages are side-shows. Comic pages are the main event.

And they do more than hold images you upload. Each comic page has a unique blog post: text with which you talk about the page du jour. They also have space for a title, description and text transcript, which are boons for [SEO](./seo).


## Comic page text

Comic pages have several text components:

- **Title and description:** A quick, SEO-friendly blurb about each page.
- **Blog post:** A title and a few [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)-savvy paragraphs let you give readers insight into the making of your comic or what’s happening that day.
- **Transcript:** Plain text that describes what characters are doing and saying in a comic page.

Blog posts and transcripts are optional, but recommended. Unique, descriptive, accurate titles are essential for your site’s archives and, again, good SEO. Use [Health Check](./health-check) to watch for too-short or redundant titles.

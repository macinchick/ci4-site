**Static page layout lets you rearrange information with a single tap.** It’s the default method of controlling pages’s appearances, although there’s also a freeform-style page.

The Grawlix CMS takes page layout seriously. Its admin panel offers you one-click options to rearrange a given static page’s contents without changing the content itself.

## Layout options

### Freeform

The “freeform” page lets you enter any HTML and [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) you want.

## Structure is flexible

The Grawlix CMS’s static page editor lets you edit bits of information each page needs. If you’re writing a FAQ, for example, you need an answer field for each question — but probably not an image. On a cast page, however, you do. The editor knows this. Kinda magical that way. Or creepy. No, magical. Go with that.

**Getting geeky:** All this works with a technology called eXtensible Markup Language, or XML. That lets us tag information like headings as being headings. Imagine that, calling things what they are. This has two advantages: First, tagged information is easy to style and rearrange without editing the information itself. Second, it makes you sound smart. Impress your friends at parties when you say “today I parsed my site’s eXtensible Markup Language docs in MySQL.”

**A web host is a company who provides your website to readers who come calling.** Their computers (a.k.a. web servers) specialize in talking to web browsers — that is, they’re designed to dish out web pages to many people at once. Thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of people. If you’re a digital cartoonist, then a web host is your printing press.

Publish your site via to a web host [FTP](./ftp).

<aside><p>Behind the scenes: The Grawlix CMS was developed on [OS X](http://osxdaily.com/2012/09/02/start-apache-web-server-mac-os-x/) and [Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com), then tested on [Bluehost](http://www.bluehost.com) among others. Why start with Dreamhost? Because we’d been using it for almost a decade, and our dues were paid. We’re on a budget, you know. [Cough](http://patreon.com/grawlixcomix).</p></aside>

Static pages
Static pages are anything not officially part of your comic. They do not appear in the archives or have back/next links.

**A “static page” holds information that doesn’t belong to your comic’s story.** Rather, these pages hold information *about the site itself.* For example:

- About the artist
- FAQ
- Cast list

… are examples of static pages. By comparison, [comic pages](./comic-pages) hold images that make up your comic and appear in the [archives](./archives).

## Content blocks

A “content block” is a unit of information, like an individual bio on the cast page or a question/answer pair on the FAQ page. Each content block can optionally have a title, image, URL to another page or site, and the content itself, usually in HTML or [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

Each static page has [layout options](./static-page-layout) that make laying out its content blocks a snap.

## Page types

In building the Grawlix CMS we discovered that most static pages fit into two categories: “text” and “list.” Common ones include:

### Text

Text pages have one block of content.

- **Welcome, new readers:** Usually an intro to the story, its history and sometimes characters.
- **About the comic:** A slightly different welcome, often more story-centric.
- **About the artist:** Bio, mission statement, how you got started, etc.
- **404 “not found” error:** A required page that appears if people find an invalid link.


### List

List pages have one many blocks of repeating content.

- **Cast of characters:** A list of people in the story, complete with names, bios and pics.
- **Links to other sites:** Let people visit other comics that you yourself enjoy.
- **Frequently asked questions:** A list of answers you get tired of telling everyone.

## Wrap up

- Static pages contain information about the site or webcomic at large.
- Unlike comic pages, static pages do not appear in the archives or have [markers](./markers).
- Static pages are made of one or more content block(s).
- “[Patterns](./static-page-patterns)” control the HTML of a static page’s content blocks.

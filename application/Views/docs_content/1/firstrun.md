The Grawlix CMS comes with a file called “firstrun.php”. As the name implies, this is the script you need to run first. Visit “yoursite.com/firstrun.php” and follow the prompts. You’ll need:

- Your database credentials, available from most [web hosts’](./web-host) control panels.
- A username and password of your choice.
- A [code editor](./code-editor).
- [FTP access](./ftp) to your host

**When you’re done installing your site, you should you delete firstrun.php.**

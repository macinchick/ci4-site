The Grawlix CMS needs a web server that runs PHP and MySQL, among other things.

**Grawlix has a few standard requirements, not unlike WordPress, Kirby, Drupal, or other popular content management systems.**

- A [web host](./web-host) with PHP 5.3 and MySQL 5 or later.
- [Permissions](./ftp-permissions) from said host to use <span class="path">.htaccess</span>.
- The ability to [FTP](./ftp) and edit bits of code.
- Money. Just kidding, [the Grawlix CMS is free](./license), though [we won’t turn down your help](http://patreon.com/grawlixcomix).

<aside><p>**Please note:** At this time, 1and1 is not compatible with the Grawlix CMS. Something about their <span class="path">.htaccess</span> restrictions doesn’t jibe.</p>

<aside><p>**Getting geeky:** The setup is commonly called a LAMP stack, short for Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP. That’s standard fair for web hosts, and you don’t have to worry about maintaining much of it. That’s what you’re paying a host for.</p></aside>

<aside><p>**Behind the scenes:** We beta tested the Grawlix CMS with popular hosts including [Dreamhost](http://dreamhost.com) and [Bluehost](http://bluehost.com). While we don’t endorse a particular web host — and there are [plenty of choices](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=web+host+reviews&t=osx) — it’s hard to go wrong with one of those for the Grawlix CMS.</p>

## Wrap up

- Version 1 of the Grawlix CMS requires PHP 5 on its host server.
- It also requires a MySQL database. By default, all of its tables are prefixed “grlx_”.
- You’ll need FTP access to upload its scripts to your web host.

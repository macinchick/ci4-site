**Social media refers to the ability to tell people about a site or comic page — “hey, check this out.”** The Grawlix CMS supports social media links in two different capacities. You can:

- Let readers *share a comic* via Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, etc.
- Let readers *follow you* at your accounts at DeviantArt, Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, etc.

You’ll need to enter your identities for each medium you wish to have people follow; share links are merely on or off.

## Comments

You can choose one of two comment services: [Disqus](https://disqus.com) or [IntenseDebate](http://www.intensedebate.com). If you want comments *(having comments at all is optional)* then enter the appropriate information into the fields provided.

<aside><p>**Behind the scenes:** When we were making good progress on the Grawlix CMS, circa mid-2014, we researched what it would take to build our own comment service. Digging around revealed security and spam concerns. A lot of them. We opted for third-party comment services for security’s sake, because many readers had already signed up for them, and because each was already doing a better job than we could.</p></aside>

## Wrap up

- The Grawlix CMS handles two types of social media links: **follow** and **share.**
- It also lets you choose from two optional comment services, Disqus and IntenseDebate.

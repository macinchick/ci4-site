**Metadata is information about information, like a title, date, description, or author.** Metadata is important for [SEO](./seo), especially titles, which Google and Bing [use in their search results pages](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35624?hl=en#3).

## The Grawlix CMS controls several kinds of metadata

- Comic and static page titles
- Page descriptions
- [Alt attributes](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/114016) in images

To edit a comic page’s title:

1. Tap the page’s “edit” icon in the [book view](./book-view).
2. Scroll down to Metadata and enter the appropriate information.

## What? No keywords meta tag?

Nope. The Grawlix CMS doesn’t use the keywords meta tag because prominent search engines like Google and Bing [ignore them](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/09/google-does-not-use-keywords-meta-tag.html).

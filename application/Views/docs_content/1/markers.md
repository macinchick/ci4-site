**Markers indicate changes in the narrative. We use markers to denote new chapters, scenes, story arcs, epilogues, even bonus material — anything that begins a new set of pages.** They’re vital to organizing a comic, but not required.

A marker is assigned to one page that acts as the beginning of a section, chapter, etc. Any given [comic page](./comic-pages) can have one marker, and a marker can only belong to one page.

## Markers vs. daily strips

If your comic is a daily or occasional strip without a set story arc or chapters, then you don’t need markers. It’s important to realize, though, that your [archives](./archives) are organized by markers — even if readers don’t notice the difference while browsing the comic.

## You say chapter, I say story arc

You can change what markers are called in the Grawlix CMS. By default, a top-level marker is a “chapter” and a second-level marker is a “scene.” Both are optional and changeable. For example, you could rename chapters to “story arcs” or “volumes,” and scenes to “part” or “chapter.” The important thing is, you can rename them to suit your needs.

## Using markers

### Create a marker

1. Go to the comic page browser in your admin panel.
2. Tap the “plus” icon in the marker column of the page you want to be your *first* page in that set.
4. You will be prompted to name the new marker. And you’re done.

### Remove a marker

1. Go to the comic page browser in your admin panel.
2. Tap the minus icon adjacent to marker you want to zap.

Removing a marker will not delete its comic page.

### Change a marker’s name

1. Go to “book view” in your admin panel.
2. Click the name of the marker you want to rename.
3. You will see a list of comic pages between that marker and the next. Tap “edit title” in the upper right.
4. When prompted, make the appropriate change on the marker editor page and tap “save.”

Changing a marker’s name will not change the name of the comic page to which it’s assigned.

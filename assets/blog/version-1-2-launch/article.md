We’re thrilled to announce that version 1.2 of the Grawlix CMS is now available for download. This version includes some long-standing fixes and features artists have reported or requested.

- The ability to uninstall a theme, making tone choices simpler
- Automatically installing tones upon installing a theme
- Remove “sort=” pagination for cleaner URLs (though they’ll still work fine for older bookmarks)
- Remove Livefyre, which Adobe bought and recently discontinued for non-enterprise use
- Fix a bug that misinterpreted links starting with “http”

… And various other little tweaks and improvements.

## How to upgrade

1. [Download the new version](http://www.getgrawlix.com/downloads)
2. Replace your \_system and \_admin folders with the new copies

We hope your enjoying your webcomic platform or, if you’re new to the system, have a great time getting started.
